#description
The "Les Caprices" website was designed to elevate the restaurant’s online presence by combining modern aesthetics with functional design. The platform highlights the restaurant’s commitment to traditional French cuisine through a visually appealing homepage that incorporates high-quality images of the dishes and ambiance. One of the key features of the website is the user-friendly reservation system, which allows visitors to easily book a table online, improving convenience and customer satisfaction.

In addition to the reservation system, the site includes comprehensive sections about the restaurant's story, its diverse menu offerings, and customer testimonials, enhancing trust and engagement. The layout is clean and responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across all devices, from desktop to mobile. Special attention was given to SEO optimization, helping Les Caprices improve its visibility on search engines and attract more customers.

Designed with both functionality and style in mind, the website serves as a digital extension of the restaurant’s ethos—providing an immersive, user-friendly experience that reflects its passion for local, high-quality cuisine. The project demonstrates how a thoughtfully crafted website can strengthen brand identity, increase customer engagement, and drive business growth.
