#description
The Jums Cookbook application was designed to simplify and enhance the way users store, organize, and share their favorite recipes. Built with Nuxt.js for a smooth, responsive interface and powered by Strapi as the backend CMS, the platform combines modern aesthetics with functional design to create an intuitive and engaging user experience.

At its core, the application allows users to effortlessly add, edit, and categorize recipes, ensuring that every dish is easy to find and manage. A powerful filtering and search system lets users explore recipes by category or ingredients, while the PDF export feature provides a convenient way to save and share their culinary creations.

The interface is designed with clarity and accessibility in mind, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices, from desktop to mobile. Every element, from the structured layout to the clean typography, is crafted to enhance usability and engagement.

More than just a digital cookbook, Jums Cookbook transforms the way families interact with their culinary heritage—offering a modern, intuitive space where traditions meet technology. The project highlights how thoughtful design and smart development can turn everyday tasks into fluid digital experiences.
