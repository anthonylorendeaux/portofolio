#description
The "Python Chrome Dinosaur project" is a side project created to learn the basics of Python and game physics. It automates the well-known Chrome Dinosaur game using Python, allowing the dinosaur to play the game without human input. This project was designed to help develop a deeper understanding of Python scripting, focusing on elements like keyboard automation, image recognition, and game logic. By simulating user actions such as jumping and ducking, it also introduces basic game physics, including collision detection and response. This simple yet engaging project serves as a great way to practice fundamental programming skills while exploring the mechanics of game development in a hands-on way.
