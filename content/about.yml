bio: |
  I am a full-stack web developer with experience in building web applications that integrate both frontend and backend technologies. One of my key projects involved creating a full-stack application with **Strapi** as the CMS. I specialize in solving complex content management problems by utilizing modern tools and frameworks like **Nuxt.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Node.js**.
  With experience working both in teams and as a solo freelancer, I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate across various industries. I thrive on delivering results that enhance user engagement and conversion rates, utilizing **SEO plugins** and **content management systems**.
  In addition to my hands-on development experience, I use **GitLab** and **GitHub Actions** to manage projects. I’m particularly interested in further improving **Three.js** visualizations.
  With an **engineering degree** and **Microsoft certification**, I have a strong technical foundation that allows me to approach problems from multiple disciplines.
